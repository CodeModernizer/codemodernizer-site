Code Modernizer keeps your Java code modern, so that

* the value of your code, and therefore your product, does not diminish over time;
* your developers can focus on creating products, rather than maintenance;
* your developers can enjoy the latest syntax, techniques, libraries;
* you do not have to keep legacy libraries, build environments 

The process is likely to make your code more compact, while maintaining excellent readability.

We promise that your tests keep running green.

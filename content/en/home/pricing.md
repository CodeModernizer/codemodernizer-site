Step wise:

1. You download the price calculator, run it on your code, obtain a detailed report.
2. From this report, you decide which transformations you want; this decides the first part of the price.
3. Contact us for a quote on the non-automated part; this decides the second part of the price.
4. We sign your NDA (example provided here), you sign our contract.
5. You give us access to the code repository, and optionally build process
6. We work our magic, and push the result in a side-branch.

The price calculator inspects your code but cannot steal it: it does not connect to the Internet. It is fully open source for you to inspect.

Our magic is based on the [e2immu](https://www.e2immu.org) static code analyser, complemented by proprietary transformation tools.
